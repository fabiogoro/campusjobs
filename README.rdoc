== README

To run this Ruby on Rails application just follow this steps:

* Clone the files to your pc. (git clone git@github.com:fabiogoro/campusjobs.git)

* Go to the new folder (cd emprego-ja)

* Run 'bundle install'

* Run 'rake db:migrate'

* Now you're ready to put the application up locally running 'rails server'

I'm assuming that you already have Ruby on Rails installed. For more info on how
to do that visit: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
